## The Founders: Slade & Chloe Skaggs

### Slade Skaggs - Founder & Program Director

**Journey:**
Slade Skaggs is not someone who studied recovery from books—he lived it. For 25 years, he navigated the darkness of substance and opiate use, experiencing multiple overdoses and near-death moments that would have claimed many others. But through that struggle, he discovered something transformative: **recovery centered not on rules, but on love**—love for self, for others, and for the world around us.

His philosophy emerged from survival and spiritual awakening: **recovery must be heart-centered and spiritually grounded**, with community accountability rooted in compassion rather than control. Slade doesn't lead from a place of authority or expertise—he leads from **shared humanity and lived experience**.

**Leadership Style:**
Slade embodies **balance**: firm structure with gentle compassion. Residents describe his homes as spaces where they are **seen, respected, and uplifted** by mutual care rather than institutional authority. He believes in **multiple pathways to recovery**—12-Step, SMART Recovery, Recovery Dharma, Medication-Assisted Treatment—all are welcome. What matters is the **individual's commitment to growth and truth**.

**Recognition & Impact:**
Slade's transformation and dedication earned recognition from **CLEAN Cause**, a sobriety-focused social enterprise, which awarded him a sober living scholarship that helped him open his first homes. His work has created a ripple effect in Austin's recovery community, establishing RCL as a beacon of **conscious, compassionate recovery**.

**Essence:**
- **Authentic** - No masks, no pretense, real human connection
- **Compassionate** - Leads with love, not judgment
- **Spiritual** - Grounded in something larger, but not dogmatic
- **Resilient** - 25 years of struggle transformed into 10+ years of service
- **Open-minded** - Embraces all recovery pathways

### Chloe Skaggs - Housing Director & Women's Program Leader

**Role:**
Chloe oversees RCL's three women's homes in North Austin, bringing **warmth, empowerment, and patience** to every interaction. Where Slade brings structure and philosophical foundation, Chloe brings **emotional intelligence and nurturing stability**. Together, they create a balanced, holistic recovery environment.

**Leadership Approach:**
Residents and community members describe Chloe as an **"inspiring leader who leads by example"**, creating trust and safety through her consistent presence and genuine care. She guides women through personal transitions with **empathy, gentleness, and spiritual strength**, helping them restore their sense of dignity and self-worth.

**Creating Safe Spaces:**
Chloe's work creates environments where women in recovery can:
- **Restore dignity** after trauma and loss
- **Develop self-accountability** without shame
- **Anchor daily routines** in love and service
- **Build authentic connections** with other women in recovery

**Philosophy:**
Chloe shares Slade's commitment to **inclusive, harm-reduction-oriented recovery**. She advocates for Medication-Assisted Treatment and individualized approaches rather than rigid, one-size-fits-all programs. Her vision reflects the essence of **person-centered, compassionate care**.

**Essence:**
- **Nurturing** - Creates emotional safety and trust
- **Empowering** - Helps women reclaim agency and strength
- **Patient** - Meets people where they are
- **Spiritually grounded** - Radiates calm, centered energy
- **Inclusive** - All pathways welcomed, all stories honored

## The Soul of Recovery Centered Living

### Core Philosophy

**"Recovery is not about abstaining—it's about learning to live from truth and compassion."**

RCL was born from the belief that recovery is **transformation**, not just behavior modification. It's about:
- Learning to act from **love** rather than fear
- Building lives that reflect **gratitude, purpose, and genuine connection**
- Creating **peer-led families** where mutual accountability replaces top-down control
- Embracing **spiritual practice** without dogma or religious requirement
- Honoring **multiple pathways** to recovery (12-Step, SMART, Recovery Dharma, MAT)

### What Makes RCL Different

**Not An Institution - A Family:**
RCL homes operate as **peer-led families**, not clinical facilities. Residents aren't patients or clients—they're **community members** learning to rebuild their lives together. This creates mutual support rooted in **shared humanity**, not hierarchy.

**Spiritual, Not Religious:**
RCL embraces **spirituality** as connection to something larger (community, nature, service, higher power of one's understanding), but rejects religious dogma. Residents are encouraged to explore their own spiritual paths.

**Harm Reduction & Evidence-Based:**
Unlike many traditional sober living programs, RCL:
- **Supports Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)** - Residents on Suboxone, Methadone, or Vivitrol are welcome
- **Embraces all recovery pathways** - Not just 12-Step (also SMART Recovery, Recovery Dharma, individual therapy)
- **Focuses on outcomes** - What matters is sustainable recovery, not adherence to ideology

**Austin Legacy:**
Slade and Chloe aren't newcomers—they're **embedded in Austin's recovery community** with deep roots, long-standing relationships, and a reputation built on **authenticity and results**. When someone chooses RCL, they're choosing a legacy of transformation.

## Tone of Voice & Messaging

### Writing Principles:

**1. First-Person When Appropriate:**
- Slade and Chloe should speak directly: "I struggled for 25 years..." (not "Slade struggled...")
- Creates intimacy and authenticity

**2. We, Not They:**
- "We believe recovery has many paths" (not "RCL believes...")
- Inclusive, community-centered language

**3. Person-First, Non-Stigmatizing:**
- "People in recovery" (not "addicts" or "recovering addicts")
- "Substance use disorder" (not "addiction" unless self-identified)
- "Lived experience" (not "former addict")

**4. Honest About Reality:**
- Don't overpromise ("We guarantee sobriety" ❌)
- Acknowledge difficulty ("Recovery is hard, and you don't have to do it alone" ✅)
- Transparent about what sober living is and isn't

**5. Hopeful But Grounded:**
- Balance realism with inspiration
- "You can rebuild your life" ✅ (hopeful, achievable)
- "Transform your entire existence overnight" ❌ (unrealistic)

### Sample Messaging:

> "Find Your Path to Recovery in Austin"
>
> Welcome to Recovery Centered Living—a community of peer-led sober homes where you're not just finding a place to stay, you're finding a family to grow with.

**Philosophy Section:**
> We believe recovery looks different for everyone. Whether you find your path through 12-Step programs, SMART Recovery, therapy, MAT, or a combination of approaches, you're welcome here. What matters isn't how you recover—it's that you're committed to truth, growth, and community.
