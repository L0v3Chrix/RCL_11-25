## 3. Video Production Scripts & Guidelines

### **Video 1: Founder Story (Slade & Chloe) - 3-5 minutes**

**Purpose:** Build trust, establish authenticity, communicate "why we exist"

**Location:** RCL house (living room or outdoor space), natural lighting

**Format:** Interview-style with B-roll intercuts

**Script/Interview Questions:**

**Opening (Slade):**
> "I spent 25 years struggling with addiction. I tried everything—treatment, meetings, willpower. But nothing stuck until I found community and accountability in a place that saw me as a person, not a problem."

**Chloe Introduction:**
> "I came into recovery differently than Slade, but what I needed was the same: a place where I could rebuild my identity beyond addiction. Where I wasn't defined by my worst moments."

**The Vision (Slade):**
> "Recovery Centered Living exists because we believe recovery isn't just about staying sober—it's about rebuilding a life worth living. That takes time, support, and a community that believes in you even when you don't believe in yourself."

**What Makes RCL Different (Chloe):**
> "In our homes, you're not a client or a case number. You're [resident name], and we care about your dreams, your struggles, your whole story. We've been where you are, and we know what you need."

**Call to Action (Both):**
> "If you're looking for a place to rebuild, to heal, to become who you were meant to be—this is it. We're here, and we're ready to walk with you."

**B-Roll Shots Needed:**
- Slade and Chloe walking through a house
- Residents in common areas (laughing, talking, cooking)
- Quiet moments of reflection
- Exterior shots of houses (establishing shots)
- Slade/Chloe interacting with residents (warm, supportive)

**Production Notes:**
- Natural, conversational tone (not scripted-sounding)
- Eye contact with camera (builds trust)
- Occasional cut to both together (partnership)
- Soft background music (hopeful, not manipulative)

---

### **Video 2: House Tour Template (1-2 minutes per house)**

**Format:** Walking tour with voiceover or on-camera house manager

**Script Template:**

**Opening (Exterior):**
> "Welcome to [House Name/Address]. This is home for [number] men/women in early recovery, and here's what makes it special."

**Living Spaces:**
> "Our living room is where community happens—meetings, movie nights, just hanging out. It's designed to feel like home, not an institution."

**Kitchen/Dining:**
> "We cook together, eat together, and learn to take care of ourselves and each other. The kitchen is the heart of the house."

**Bedrooms:**
> "Each resident has their own private space—your room, your sanctuary. This is where you can breathe, think, and just be."

**Outdoor/Special Features:**
> "We've got [backyard/patio/parking/unique feature]—little things that make life easier and more comfortable."

**Closing:**
> "This isn't just a place to sleep. It's a launchpad for the life you're building. We'd love to show you around in person."

**Production Tips:**
- Use stabilizer/gimbal for smooth walking shots
- Natural lighting (shoot during day)
- Show spaces occupied (not empty/sterile)
- Include sounds (birds, laughter, daily life)
- Keep it under 2 minutes (attention span)

6. "What would you tell someone who's scared to take this step?"
7. "Where do you see yourself in a year?"

**Resident Preparation:**
- Explain how footage will be used (website, social media)

- Ensure they're comfortable and not coerced
- Let them review final edit before publishing

**Production Notes:**
