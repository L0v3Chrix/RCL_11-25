## Content Collection Plan

### Immediate Needs (RCL Site):

**Photography:**

- [ ] Austin location context photos (neighborhoods, nearby amenities)

**Video:**
- [ ] Slade & Chloe welcome/intro video (2-3 minutes)

- [ ] "A Day in the Life" documentary-style video (5 minutes)
- [ ] 6-10 alumni testimonial videos (3-5 minutes each)
- [ ] Family Q&A video (5 minutes)

**Written Content:**

- [ ] Success rate data and outcomes metrics
- [ ] Partner organization list and descriptions

### Content Placeholder Strategy:

**If Not Ready Immediately:**
- Use thoughtfully chosen stock imagery (authentic, diverse, warm) as placeholders
- Generate AI copy for sections missing text (then refine with Slade/Chloe input)
- Use wireframe boxes with labels for video placeholders
- Lorem ipsum ONLY in design mockups, never in development

---

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Potential Risks:

**1. Content Delays:**
- Risk: Photography and video production takes longer than expected
- Mitigation: Start with placeholders, phase content in post-launch, or hire professional production team

**2. Technical Complexity:**
- Risk: Member/family portal and white-label architecture add significant dev time
- Mitigation: Phase portal features (launch with basic version, enhance later), simplify white-label scope for MVP

**3. HIPAA Compliance:**
- Risk: Storing resident health information requires strict compliance
- Mitigation: Avoid storing PHI if possible (use third-party HIPAA-compliant tools), consult compliance expert

**4. Scope Creep:**
- Risk: Additional features requested during development
- Mitigation: Strict change management process, phase 2 roadmap for future enhancements

**5. Stakeholder Alignment:**
- Risk: Slade and Chloe have different priorities or change vision mid-project
- Mitigation: Regular check-ins, clear approval process at each milestone, written sign-offs

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Review and approve this scope document** with Slade and Chloe
2. **Prioritize features** (Phase 1 MVP vs. Phase 2 enhancements)
3. **Schedule stakeholder interviews** for deeper discovery
4. **Begin content collection** (photos, videos, written materials)
5. **Create design system** (see `2025-10-21-brand-essence.md` and `2025-10-21-design-system.md`)
6. **Competitive analysis** of top sober living websites

**This Week:**
- Finalize scope and get stakeholder approval
- Begin design research and mood board creation
- Start wireframing homepage and key pages
- Outline content production plan and timelines
