## Design Trends for Wellness/Healthcare 2024-2025

### Color Trends

**Calming, Nature-Inspired Palettes:**
- **Soft greens** (#AAEEC4, #5d8a5d) - Growth, renewal, healing
- **Warm earth tones** (#9b7355, #d4b5a0) - Grounding, stability, comfort
- **Muted pastels** (soft peaches, light blues) - Hope, gentleness
- **Warm neutrals** (cream, warm grays) - Breathing room, clarity

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Clinical whites and cold blues (too institutional)
- ❌ Harsh, high-contrast color schemes (creates stress)
- ❌ Overly bright or saturated colors (overwhelming for recovery audience)

**RCL Application:**
- Primary: Warm earth tones (terracotta, sandy beige, warm brown)
- Secondary: Soft greens (sage, moss, muted olive) for CTAs
- Accent: Sunset orange/coral for hope and action
- Neutrals: Cream and warm grays for backgrounds

### Typography Trends

**Readability-First Approach:**
- **Serif headings** for warmth and trustworthiness (Crimson Pro, Lora, Playfair Display)
- **Sans-serif body** for modern readability (Inter, Manrope, Plus Jakarta Sans)
- **Large type sizes** (18px+ for body text, mobile accessibility)
- **Generous line height** (1.6-1.8 for body, 1.2-1.4 for headings)
- **Reduced font weight** (400-500 for body, avoiding overly bold text)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Condensed or narrow fonts (hard to read)
- ❌ All caps for large blocks of text (accessibility issue)
- ❌ Overly decorative fonts (unprofessional)
- ❌ Small font sizes (<16px body text)

**RCL Application:**
- Headings: Crimson Pro (serif, warm, grounded)
- Body: Inter (sans-serif, highly readable)
- Accent: Caveat (handwritten, used sparingly for quotes)

### Layout Trends

**Spacious, Breathing Layouts:**
- **Generous white space** (min 80px-120px section padding)
- **Grid-based organization** with clear columns
- **Asymmetric layouts** (more interesting than perfect symmetry)
- **Card-based design** for content organization
- **Full-width hero sections** with compelling imagery
- **Sticky navigation** for easy access to key actions

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Cluttered, text-heavy pages (overwhelming)
- ❌ Perfectly centered, rigid layouts (feels corporate)
- ❌ Excessive sidebar content (distracting)
- ❌ Too many competing visual elements

**RCL Application:**
- Large hero sections with authentic photography
- Card-based house showcases
- Generous white space throughout
- Asymmetric content blocks for visual interest
- Sticky header with crisis support always accessible

### Interaction & Animation Trends

**Subtle, Purposeful Motion:**
- **Micro-interactions** on hover (scale, lift, color shift)
- **Scroll-triggered animations** (fade in, slide up as user scrolls)
- **Parallax effects** (subtle depth on hero sections)
- **Smooth transitions** (300-500ms with ease-out)
- **Loading states** that are delightful, not boring
- **Progress indicators** for multi-step forms

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Excessive animation (distracting, reduces accessibility)
- ❌ Auto-playing videos with sound (annoying)
- ❌ Long, slow animations (user frustration)
- ❌ Animations that cause layout shift (CLS issue)

**RCL Application:**
- Gentle fade-in animations as sections enter viewport
- Hover lift effect on house cards
- Smooth color transitions on CTAs
- Progress bar for 3-step intake
- Scroll-triggered testimonial reveals

### Trust-Building Visual Elements

**Healthcare/Wellness Best Practices:**
- **Large, professional headshots** (Slade & Chloe, house managers)
- **Authentic photography** (real people, real places, real moments)
- **Video testimonials** (face-to-camera, genuine stories)
- **Certification/accreditation logos** (but not overdone)
- **Data visualization** (success rates, outcomes) when available
- **Transparent information** (no hidden details, clear expectations)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Stock photography (immediately destroys trust)
- ❌ Overly posed or staged photos (feels fake)
- ❌ Too many certification logos (looks desperate)
- ❌ Vague, unsubstantiated claims

**RCL Application:**
- Professional portraits of Slade & Chloe (warm, approachable)
- Real photos of all 6 houses (exteriors, interiors, common spaces)
- Video testimonials from alumni (unscripted, authentic)
- Success metrics presented simply (% completion rates, years sober)
- Slade's transformation story (25 years struggle → service)

## Accessibility-First Design Patterns

### Color Contrast

**WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements:**
- Normal text: 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratio
- Large text: 3:1 minimum contrast ratio
- UI components: 3:1 minimum contrast ratio

**RCL Verified Combinations:**
✅ Primary-800 (#432d21) on white: 10.2:1
✅ Neutral-800 (#292524) on white: 11.4:1
✅ White on accent-500 (#f26d2b): 4.7:1
✅ White on secondary-600 (#4a6f4a): 5.1:1

### Keyboard Navigation

**Requirements:**
- All interactive elements accessible via Tab key
- Visible focus indicators (outline or border)
- Skip navigation links for screen readers
- Logical tab order matching visual hierarchy

**RCL Implementation:**
- Focus ring: 2px solid secondary-500 with 2px offset
- Skip to main content link (screen reader only until focused)
- Form fields tab in logical order (top to bottom, left to right)

### Screen Reader Support

**Requirements:**
- Semantic HTML (proper heading hierarchy, landmarks)
- Alt text for all images (descriptive, not "image of...")
- ARIA labels where needed (especially icons and controls)
- Form labels properly associated with inputs

**RCL Implementation:**
- `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>` landmarks
- H1 → H2 → H3 hierarchy (no skipping levels)
- Alt text: "Slade and Chloe Skaggs, founders of Recovery Centered Living"
- All form inputs have visible labels

## Performance Optimization Design

### Image Optimization

**Best Practices:**
- **Next.js Image component** (automatic optimization)
- **WebP format** with JPG fallback
- **Lazy loading** for below-fold images
- **Responsive sizes** (different images for mobile/tablet/desktop)
- **Blur placeholder** while loading

**RCL Application:**
- Hero images: 1920x1080 max, WebP, quality 85
- House photos: 800x500 max, WebP, quality 80
- Portraits: 400x400 max, WebP, quality 85
- All images lazy-loaded except hero

### Font Loading

**Best Practices:**
- **Self-hosted fonts** via next/font (no FOUT)
- **Font subsetting** (only characters used)
- **Preload critical fonts**
- **Variable fonts** where possible (fewer files)

**RCL Application:**
- Crimson Pro: Variable weight 400-700, Latin subset
- Inter: Variable weight 400-700, Latin subset
- Caveat: Weight 400, Latin subset
- All fonts preloaded, display=swap

### Animation Performance

**Best Practices:**
- **Use transform and opacity** (GPU-accelerated)
- **Avoid animating width, height, top, left** (causes reflow)
- **Use will-change** sparingly (for complex animations only)
- **Reduce motion** media query support

**RCL Application:**
```css
/* Good: GPU-accelerated */
.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  transition: transform 300ms ease-out;
}

/* Avoid: Causes reflow */
.card:hover {
  margin-top: -4px; /* ❌ */
}

/* Respect user preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

## Mobile-First Design Considerations

### Touch-Friendly Targets

**Requirements:**
- Minimum 44x44px tap targets (Apple HIG)
- Adequate spacing between tap targets (min 8px)
- Visible press states (feedback on touch)

**RCL Application:**
- Buttons: min 48px height, full width on mobile
- Links: min 44px height (add padding if needed)
- Form inputs: 52px height for comfortable tapping
- Spacing between clickable elements: 12px minimum

### Mobile Navigation

**Best Practices:**
- **Hamburger menu** or **bottom navigation** for mobile
- **Sticky header** with key actions always accessible
- **One-thumb operation** (important controls in reach)
- **Swipe gestures** where appropriate (image galleries)

**RCL Application:**
- Sticky header: Logo + Hamburger + Crisis support (SMS icon)
- Hamburger opens full-screen menu with large tap targets
- Bottom sticky bar on forms: "Save & Continue" always visible
- House photo galleries: Swipe to navigate

### Content Hierarchy on Mobile

**Priorities:**
1. Value proposition (what is this?)
2. Primary CTA (how do I take action?)
3. Trust indicators (why should I trust this?)
4. Key information (what do I need to know?)
5. Secondary content (nice to have)

**RCL Mobile Homepage Order:**
1. Hero: Value prop + Apply Now CTA + Crisis support
2. Slade & Chloe's story (2-min video)
3. Our houses (swipeable cards, 2 beds available!)
4. Success stories (1-2 featured testimonials)
5. What to expect (simple 4-step process)
6. FAQs (collapsible accordion)
7. Footer (contact, resources)

## Interaction Pattern Library

### Hover States

**Buttons:**
```css
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--accent-500);
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: all 300ms ease-out;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background: var(--accent-600);
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-md);
}
```

**Cards:**
```css
.house-card {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-warm);
  transition: all 300ms ease-out;
}

.house-card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-xl);
}

.house-card img {
  transform: scale(1);
  transition: transform 500ms ease-out;
}

.house-card:hover img {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

**Links:**
```css
.text-link {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--primary-600);
}

.text-link::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -2px;
  left: 0;
  width: 0;
  height: 2px;
  background: var(--primary-600);
  transition: width 300ms ease-out;
}

.text-link:hover::after {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### Scroll Animations

**Fade In on Scroll:**
```javascript
// Using Framer Motion
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{ once: true, amount: 0.3 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5, ease: 'easeOut' }}
>
  {content}
</motion.div>
```

**Sticky Progress Bar (Form):**
```javascript
const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);

// Update progress based on scroll or step
<div className="sticky top-0 z-50 bg-white">
  <div className="h-1 bg-neutral-200">
    <div
      className="h-full bg-secondary-500 transition-all duration-300"
      style={{ width: `${progress}%` }}
    />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Loading States

**Skeleton Screens:**
```tsx
// Instead of spinner, show content skeleton
<div className="animate-pulse">
  <div className="h-8 bg-neutral-200 rounded w-3/4 mb-4" />
  <div className="h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded w-full mb-2" />
  <div className="h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded w-5/6" />
</div>
```

**Button Loading:**
```tsx
<button disabled={isLoading}>
  {isLoading ? (
    <>
      <Spinner className="mr-2" />
      Submitting...
    </>
  ) : (
    'Submit Application'
  )}
</button>
```
